# To-Do-Site

## Reasons
I need an application that save to-do lists for me, and it can't be Notion, because sometimes it's slow and I have some others things there.

## Objectives
- Pretty interface
- Easy to use
- Fast
- Can be used in PC and cellphone

## Future Releases (news)

### The new saving method (v0.6)
As IP is not working like we want, we'll create a new saving method.
Using a login system (sign in and sign up), and using cookies to keep the client logged in.
Saving the accounts in MongoDB, saving the TO DOs also in MongoDB and saving the preferences in cache (localStorage).
